This directory contains the instructions and software needed to install the Shiny XXXX application on a local computer (Windows Operating System) with which the work is illustrated:

from the authors:

Odei Garcia-Garin, Toni Monleón-Getino, Pere López-Brosa, Asunción Borrell, Alex Aguilar, Ricardo Borja-Robalino, Luis Cardona, Morgana Vighi

Where a shiny APP application for the detection of plastic in the sea from images is described, which is described in the work.

First you must have R (version 3.6) and Rstudio installed, which must support Shiny applications.

Follow the installation instructions that you will find in the instal_paquets.R file to be executed in R.

Run the shiny application that appears in the AllPlast directory from RStudio as usual with Shiny applications (see https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/introduction-to-shiny/)

Inside the test IMAGES folder you will find different images with and without plastic in order to carry out tests.
